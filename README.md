# Armada  
Serverless API

### Why Armada?
+ Just don't want to deal with servers any more.  
+ AWS Lambdas are super cheap compared to EC2 containers running your microservices.  
+ Who doesn't love the microservices architecture? It's the way to go these days.

#### Definition of armada

> 1 : a fleet of warships
> 2 : a large force or group usually of moving things
